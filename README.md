# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is an implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be suitable for implementation into my soon to be gaming social media site. It has been developed with a focus on animation and responsiveness aswell as learning the languages.
